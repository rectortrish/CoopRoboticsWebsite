                    Come learn how to code! This class is for elementary students who love to build with LEGO and
                    who are eager to learn the fundamentals of computer programming. During the first half of the
                    year, students work in partner pairs to build and program LEGO models ranging from interactive
                    animal designs to Battlebots and race cars. The second half of the year takes students into the
                    fundamentals of programming with Scratch 3.0, a popular block-based programming language, with a
                    series of progressively challenging art and game projects. </p>

                    This class is for students who have ever wondered what it takes to create fantastic computer games!
                    This
                    is a bridge class from intermediate level block coding with Scratch 3.0 into the scripting language
                    Python. Students are guided through series of fun and challenging intermediate level game projects
                    in
                    both Scratch 3.0 and beginning Python are encouraged to modify each project with open-ended hacks
                    and
                    tweaks. Games projects include puzzles, quizzes, strategy games, and geometric designs. </p>

                    Come take a deep dive into the one of the most popular Python programming books, Python Crash
                    Course, by
                    Eric Matthes! Learn the finer details of basic programming concepts such as variables, lists,
                    conditionals, functions, and classes and objects. Students will learn how to write clean code with
                    exercises for each topic and how to test code safely before adding it to projects. <br>
                    After covering the fundamentals or programming in Python, students will put their new knowledge into
                    practice with three substantial projects: a Space Invaders inspired arcade game, a set of data
                    visualizations with Python&#39;s handy libraries, and a simple web app that can be deployed online.
