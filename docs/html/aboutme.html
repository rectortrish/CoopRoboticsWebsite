                <p>My name is Patricia Rector and I&#39;ve been gratefully teaching in the homeschool community since
                    2010. Sharing the fun of robotics and beginning coding with elementary students fills me with joy,
                    and guiding middle school students into the broad world of programming languages keeps me on my
                    toes! I am blessed with family and have two grown sons who led us through many years of
                    homeschooling adventures. In my spare time I enjoy hiking, reading, and finding new rabbit trails of
                    curious oddities to learn about. <br>
